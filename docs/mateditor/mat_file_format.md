# Material library file format


Material library data follows the MatML 3.1 Schema for saving material data to external libraries on disk. More information about MatML can be found at <http://matml.org>. For an example of the format see the [Export individual data](../mat_perform_tasks/#export-individual-data) item in the [Perform Basic Tasks in Material](mat_perform_tasks) section and then open the file with a text/xml editor.
