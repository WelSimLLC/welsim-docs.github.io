# Welcome
<!-- ## Welcome -->
WELSIM was born out of a vision to create a general-purpose simulation utility that could successfully enable a wide range of engineering and science communities to conduct simulation with more confidence. Customers use our software to help ensure the integrity of their innovations. WELSIM comes with an all-in-one user interface and self-integrated features. It is a long-term-support product that aims to accurately model engineering problems using the prestigious open source solvers.

## Where to start
Engineers can do a thousand things with the WELSIM simulation solutions. We recommend starting with:

* [Quick start][3] to quickly review the steps of using WELSIM.
* [Windows][4] and [Linux][5] installation guides to install the software on your computer.

If you already use WELSIM:

* [User's manual][6] - learn about WELSIM user interfaces and how to use them for everything else.
* [Theory][7] - learn about math theory and numerical algorithms used in WELSIM.

If you are interested in our free engineering software:

* [CurveFitter][10] - learn about the curve fitting tool. 
* [MatEditor][9] - learn about the engineering material data tool. 
* [UnitConverter][8] - learn about the engineering unit convertion tool.
* [BeamSection][11] - learn about the beam cross-section tool.
