<!-- 
Curve fitting is one of the most widely used analysis methods in science and technology. Curve fitting examines the relationship between one or more predictors (independent variables) and a response variable (dependent variable), with the goal of defining a "best fit" model of the relationship. It is reportedly used in crystallography, chromatography, photoluminescence and photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared, Raman spectroscopy, and finite element analysis.

## Linear, Polynomial Regression
Linear and Polynomial regressions in CurveFitter make use of the least-square method to fit a linear model function or a polynomial model function to data, respectively.

## Magnetic Core Loss Model Fitting
Core Loss Model fitting tool enables you to fit the parameters in estimating energy loss analysis. The tabular data window contains both regular tables and sub-tables for you to input multiple frequency-based data. The chart supports the logarithmic axis to better review the frequency-based curves.
