* Transient Structural and Thermal: Current Step (Read-Only), Auto-Timing, Number of SubSteps, Time Incremental (Shown as Auto Timing is False), Relative Tolerance, Absolute Tolerance, Maximum Iterations. 
* Modal Structural: Number of Modes, Lancos Tolerance, Lancos Iterations.
* ElectroStatic and MagnetoStatic: Current Step (Read-Only), Relative Tolerance, Absolute Tolerance, Maximum Iterations. 

### Spreadsheet 
The Study Settings object can display the Spreadsheet window, which provides a friendly user interface to review properties at all steps as shown in Figure [fig:ch3_guide_obj_study_settings]. You can double click or right click on the Study Settings object and select the Edit command to display the Spreadsheet window.
