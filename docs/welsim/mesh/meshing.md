# Meshing Overview

## Philosophy
The goal of meshing in WELSIM is to provide easy-to-use and stable meshing utilities that will simplify the mesh generation process.

## Physics-based meshing
The WELSIM mesh generation is set based on the physics and engineering preferences. Particularly, the mesh system targets on the **mechanical**, **thermal** and **electromagnetics** physics. 

## Meshing application interface
The intuitive Meshing applicaiton interface, shown in the figure below, faciliates your use of all meshing controls and settings.


The funcational elements of the interface are described in the following table.

| **Window Component** | **Description** |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Main Menu | This menu includes all basic menus such as **File** and **Mesh**. |
| Standard Toolbar | This toolbar contains commonly used application commands. |
| Graphics Toolbar | This toolbar contains commands that control pointer mode or cause an action in the graphics browser.| 
| Tree Outline | Outline view of the project. Always visible. Location in the outline sets the context for other controls. Provides access to object's context menus. Allows renaming of objects. Establishes what details display in the Details View. |
| Property Details View | The Details View corresponds to the Outline selection. Displays a details window on the lower left panel (by default) which contains details about each object in the Outline.| 
| Geometry Window (also sometimes called the Graphics window) | Displays and manipulates the visual representation of the object selected in the Outline. This window may display: <\br>
