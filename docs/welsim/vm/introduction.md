WELSIM Verification Manual presents a collection of test cases that demonstrate a number of the capabilities of the WELSIM analysis environment. The available tests are engineering problems that provide independent verification, usually a closed form equation. Many of them are classical engineering problems.

# Introduction

##  Index of test cases
The following lists all verification cases tested with WELSIM application. Each case entry describes the test case number, element type, analysis type, and solution options.

* VM001: Solid Element, Static Structural, Linear.
* VM002: Solid Element, Static Structural, Linear.
* VM003: Solid Element, Steady-State Thermal, Linear.
