# Libraries and properties


## Definitions
We make use of the following terminology for materials:

| Term | Definition | 
| ---- | ---------- |
| Material | An identifier that contains a property or multiple properties |
| Property | An identifier the singular information (for example, Density) | 
| Property data | An identifier for tabular data (for example, Thermal Conductivity) |


## Sample libraries

Material Module provides sample material data categorized into several libraries. However, you still need to validate that the data is consistent with the material you are using in your analysis.

The following materials are included:

* **General Materials**: A library of general use materials and consists mostly of metals.
* **General Nonlinear Materials**: A library of general use nonlinear materials for performing nonlinear analyses.
* **Hyperelastic Materials**: A library of materials containing test data which can be used to represent hyperelastic materails. The data doesn't correspond to any particular material.
* **Thermal Materials**: A library of materials containing thermal data.
* **Electromagnetic Materials**: A library of materials containing electromagnetic data, specific for use in an electromagnetic analysis.
