if you want to import your database, uncomment the line for `postgres-init` volume in your compose file. Create the volume directory `./postgres-init` in the same directory as the compose file and put there your `.sql .sql.gz .sh` file(s). All SQL files will be automatically imported once Postgres container has started.
