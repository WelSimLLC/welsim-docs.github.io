ADAPTIVE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD/ADAPTIVE MESHING \uff1a An adaptive finite element solver iteratively performs finite element analysis, determines the areas of the mesh where the solution is not sufficiently accurate and refines the mesh in those areas until the solution obtains the prescribed degree of accuracy. Adaptive Meshing involves automatically improving the mesh where necessary to meet specified convergence criteria. ASPECT RATIO : The ratio of the longest to shortest side lengths on an element. ASSEMBLY : Geometric:Two or more parts mated together. FEA: The process of assembling the element matrices together to form the global matrix. Typically element stiffness matrices are assembled to form the complete stiffness matrix of the structure. AUTOMATIC MESH GENERATION : The process of generating a mesh of elements over the volume that is being analyzed. There are two forms of automatic mesh generation: Free Meshing -Where the mesh has no structure to it. Free meshing generally uses triangular and tetrahedral elements. Mapped Meshing -Where large regions, if not all, of the volume is covered with regular meshes. This can use any form of element. Free meshing can be used to fill any shape. Mapped meshing can only be used on some shapes without elements being excessively distorted. AXISYMMETRY : If a shape can be defined by rotating a cross- section about a line (e.g. a cone) then it is said to be axisymmetric. This can be used to simplify the analysis of the system. Such models are sometimes called two and a half dimensional since a 2D cross- section represents a 3D body. B \u00b6 BARLOW POINTS \uff1a The set of Gauss integration points that give the best estimates of the stress for an element. For triangles and tetrahedra these are the full Gauss integration points. For quadrilateral and brick elements they are the reduced Gauss points. BASIS SPACE \uff1a When an element is being constructed it is derived from a simple regular shape in non-dimensional coordinates. The coordinates used to define the simple shape form the basis space. In its basis space a general quadrilateral is a 2\u00d72 square and a general triangle is an isosceles triangle with unit side lengths. BEAM ELEMENT : A line element that has both translational and rotational degrees of freedom. It represents both membrane and bending actions. BENDING : Bending behavior is where the strains vary linearly from the centerline of a beam or center surface of a plate or shell.There is zero strain on the centerline for pure bending. Plane sections are assumed to remain plane. If the stresses are constant normal to the centerline then this is called membrane behavior. BENDING STRESS : A compressive and/or tensile stress resulting from the application of a nonaxial force to a structural member. BODY FORCE VECTOR : Mechanical loadings within the interior of the volume, typically inertia loadings in a stiffness analysis. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS : The boundary conditions of a function are values of the function at the edge of the range of some of its variables. Knowledge of some of the boundary conditions is needed to solve an engineering problem or to find an unknown function. BOUNDARY ELEMENT/INTEGRAL : A method of solving differential equations by taking exact solutions to the field equations loaded by a point source and then finding the strengths of sources distributed around the boundary of the body required to satisfy the boundary conditions on the body. BUBBLE FUNCTIONS : Element shape functions that are zero along the edges of the element. They are non-zero within the interior of the element. BUCKLING (SNAP THROUGH) : The situation where the elastic stiffness of the structure is cancelled by the effects of compressive stress within the structure. If the effect of this causes the structure to suddenly displace a large amount in a direction normal to the load direction then it is classical bifurcation buckling. If there is a sudden large movement in the direction of the loading it is snap through buckling. C \u00b6 CAE : computer aided engineering. CENTRAL DIFFERENCE METHOD : A method for numerically integrating second order dynamic equations of motion. It is widely used as a technique for solving non-linear dynamic problems. CHARACTERISTIC VALUE : Same as the eigenvalue. CHARACTERISTIC VECTOR : Same as the eigenvector. CHOLESKY FACTORISATION (SKYLINE) : A method of solving a set of simultaneous equations that is especially well suited to the finite element method. It is sometimes called a skyline solution. Choose to optimize the profile o f the matrix if a renumbering scheme is used. COEFFICIENT OF VISCOUS DAMPING : The system parameter relating force to velocity. COMPATIBILITY OF STRAINS : Compatibility of strain is satisfied if strains that are continuous before loading are continuous after. COMPLETE DISPLACEMENT FIELD : When the functions interpolating the field variable (typically the displacements) form a complete nth order polynomial in all directions. COMPLEX EIGENVALUES : The eigenvectors of a damped system. For proportionally damped systems they are the same as the undamped eigenvectors. For non-proportionally damped systems with damping in all modes less th an critical they are complex numbers and occur as complex conjugate pairs. COMPLEX EIGENVECTORS : The eigenvalues of any damped system. If the damping is less than critical they will occur as complex conjugate pairs even for proportionally damped systems. The real part of the complex eigenvalue is a measure of the damping in the mode and should always be negative. The imaginary part is a measure of the resonant frequency. COMPOSITE MATERIAL : A material that is made up of discrete components, typically a carbon-epoxy composite material or a glass-fiber material. Layered material and foam materials are also forms of composite materials. COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) : A computer-based numerical study of turbulent fluid flow using approximate methods such as the finite element method, the fine difference method, the boundary element method, the finite volume methods, and so on. CONDITION NUMBER : The ratio of the highest eigenvalue to the lowest eigenvalue of a matrix. The exponent of this number gives a measure of the number of digits required in the computation to maintain numerical accuracy. The higher the condition number the more chance of numerical error and the slower the rate of convergence for iterative solutions. CONDITIONAL/UNCONDITIONAL STABILITY : Any scheme for numerically integrating dynamic equations of motion in a step-by- step form is conditionally stable if there is a maximum time step value that can be used. It is unconditionally stable (but not necessarily accurate) if any length of time step can be used. CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD : A method for solving simultaneous equations iteratively. It is closely related to the Lanczos method for finding the first few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a set of equations. CONSISTENT DISPLACEMENTS AND FORCES : The displacements and forces act at the same point and in the same direction so that the sum of their products give a work quantity. If consistent displacements and forces are used the resulting stiffness and mass matrices are symmetric. CONSTANT STRAIN CONSTANTSTRESS : For structural analysis an element must be able to reproduce a state of constant stress and strain under a suitable loading to ensure that it will converge to the correct solution. This is tested for using the patch test. CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONSHIPS : The equations defining the material behavior for an infinitesimal volume of material. For structures these are the stress -strain laws and include Hookes law for elasticity and the Prandle-Reuss equations for plasticity. CONSTRAINT EQUATIONS (MULTI POINT CONSTRAINTS) : If one group of variables can be defined in terms of another group then the relationship between the two are constraint equations. Typically the displacements on the face of an element can be constrained to remain plane but the plane itself can move. CONSTRAINTS : Known values of, or relationships between, the displacements in the coordinate system. CONTACT PROBLEMS : A contact problem occurs when two bodies that are originally apart can come together, or two bodies that are originally connected can separate. CONTINUOUS MASS MODELS : The system mass is distributed between the degrees of freedom. The mass matrix is not diagonal. CONTOUR PLOTTING : A graphical representation of the variation of a field variable over a surface, such as stress, displacement, or temperature. A contour line is a line of constant value for the variable. A contour band is an area of a single color for values of the variable within two limit values. CONVERGENCE REQUIREMENTS : For a structural finite element to converge as the mesh is refined it must be able to represent a state of constant stress and strain free rigid body movements exactly. There are equivalent requirements for other problem types. CRANK-NICHOLSON SCHEME : A method for numerically integrating first order dynamic equations of motion. It is widely used as a technique for solving thermal transient problems. CRITICAL ENERGY RELEASE : This is a material property defining the minimum energy that a propagating crack must release in order for it to propagate. Three critical energies, or modes of crack propagation, have been identified. Mode 1 is the two surfaces of the crack moving apart. Mode 2 is where the two surfaces slide from front to back. Mode 3 is where the to surfaces slide sideways. CRITICALLY DAMPED SYSTEM CRITICAL DAMPING : The dividing line between under damped and over damped systems where the equation of motion has a damping value that is equal to the critical damping. CYCLIC SYMMETRY : A generalization of axisymmetry. The structure is composed of a series of identical sectors that are arranged circumferentially to form a ring. A turbine disc with blades attached is atypical example. D \u00b6 DAMPED EIGENVALUES : Same as complex eigenvalues. DAMPED EIGENVECTORS : Same as complex eigenvectors. DAMPED NATURAL FREQUENCY : The frequency at which the damped system vibrates naturally when only an initial disturbance is applied. DAMPING : Any mechanism that dissipates energy in a vibrating system. DAMPING FACTOR (DECAY FACTOR) : The damping factor is the ratio of the actual damping to the critical damping. It is often specified as a percentage. If the damping factor is less than one then the system can undergo free vibrations. The free vibrations will decay to zero with time. If the damping factor is greater than one then the decay is exponential and no vibrations occur. For most structures the damping factor is very small. DEGENERATE ELEMENTS : Elements that are defined as one shape in the basis space but they are a simpler shape in the real space. A quadrilateral can degenerate into a triangle. A brick element can degenerate into a wedge, a pyramid or a tetrahedron. Degenerate elements should be avoided in practice. DEGREES OF FREEDOM : The number of equations of equilibrium for the system. In dynamics, the number of displacement quantities which must be considered in order to represent the effects of all of the significant inertia forces. Degrees of freedom define the ability of a given node to move in any direction in space. There are six types of DOF for any given node: 3 possible translations (one each in the X,Y and Z directions) and 3 possible rotations (one rotation about each of the X,Y, and X axes). DOF are defined and restricted by the elements and constraints associated with each node. DET(J) DET J : The Jacobian matrix is used to relate derivatives in the basis space to the real space. The determinant of the Jacobian \u2013 det(j) -is a measure of the distortion of the element when mapping from the basis to the real space. DEVIATORIC STRESS STRESS DEVIATORS : A measure of stress where the hydrostatic stress has been subtracted from the actual stress. Material failures that are flow failures (plasticity and creep) fail independently of the hydrostatic stress. The failure is a function of the deviatoric stress. DIAGONAL GENERALIZED MATRIX : The eigenvectors of a system can be used to define a coordinate transformation such that, in these generalized coordinates the coefficient matrices (typically mass and stiffness) are diagonal. DIE-AWAY LENGTH : If there is a stress concentration in a structure the high stress will reduce rapidly with distance from the peak value. The distance over which it drops to some small value is called the die-away length. A fine mesh is required over this die-away length for accurate stress results. DIRECT INTEGRATION : The name for various techniques for numerically integrating equations of motion. These are either implicit or explicit methods and include central difference, Crank-Nicholson, Runge-Kutta, Newmark beta and Wilson theta. DISCRETE PARAMETER MODELS (DISCRETISED APPROACH) : The model is defined in terms of an ordinary differential equation and the system has a finite number of degrees of freedom. DISCRETIZATION : The process of dividing geometry into smaller pieces (finite elements) to prepare for analysis, i.e. Meshing. DISPLACEMENT METHOD (DISPLACEMENT SOLUTION) :A form of discrete parameter model where the displacements of the system are the basic unknowns. DISPLACEMENT : The distance, translational and rotational, that a node travels from its initial position to its post-analysis position. The total displacement is represented by components in each of the 3 translational directions and the 3 rotational directions. DISPLACEMENT PLOTS : Plots showing the deformed shape of the structure. For linear small deflection problems the displacements are usually multiplied by a magnifying factor before plotting the deformed shape. DISPLACEMENT VECTOR : The nodal displacements written as a column vector. DOMAIN : In mathematics, a domain is the set of independent variables for which a function is defined. In finite element analysis, a domain is a continuous system (region) over which the laws of physics govern. In structural engineering, a domain could be a beam or a complete building frame. In mechanical engineering, a domain could be a piece of machine parts or a thermal field. DRUCKER-PRAGER EQUIVALENT STRESSES : An equivalent stress measure for friction materials (typically sand). The effect of hydrostatic stress is included in the equivalent stress. DYNAMIC ANALYSIS : An analysis that includes the effect of the variables changing with time as well as space. DYNAMIC FLEXIBILITY MATRIX : The factor relating the steady state displacement response of a system to a sinusoidal force input. It is the same as the recep tance. DYNAMIC MODELLING : A modeling process where consideration as to time effects in addition to spatial effects are included. A dynamic model can be the same as a static model or it can differ significantly depending upon the nature of the problem. DYNAMIC RESPONSE : The time dependent response of a dynamic system in terms of its displacement, velocity or acceleration at any given point of the system. DYNAMIC STIFFNESS MATRIX : If the structure is vibrating steadily at a frequency w then the dynamic stiffness is (K+iwC w2M) It is the inverse of the dynamic flexibility matrix. DYNAMIC STRESSES \uff1aStresses that vary with time and space. DYNAMIC SUBSTRUCTURING \uff1a Special forms of substructuring used within a dynamic analysis. Dynamic substructuring is always approximate and causes some loss of accuracy in the dynamic solution. E \u00b6 EIGENVALUE PROBLEM \uff1a Problems that require calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for their solution. Typically solving free vibration problems or finding buckling loads. ELASTIC FOUNDATION \uff1a If a structure is sitting on a flexible foundation the supports are treated as a continuous elastic foundation. The elastic foundation can have a significant effect upon the structural response. ELASTIC STIFFNESS \uff1a If the relationship between loads and displacements is linear then the problem is elastic. For a multi-degree of freedom system the forces and displacements are related by the elastic stiffness matrix. ELECTRIC FIELDS \uff1a Electro-magnetic and electro-static problems form electric field problems. ELEMENT\uff1a An element is a portion of the problem domain, and is typically some simple shape like a triangle or quadrilateral in 2D, or tetrahedron or hex solid in 3D. ELEMENT ASSEMBLY \uff1a Individual element matrices have to be assembled into the complete stiffness matrix. This is basically a process of summing the element matrices. This summation has to be of the correct form. For the stiffness method the summation is based upon the fact that element displacements at common nodes must be the same. ELEMENT STRAINS/STRESSES \uff1a Stresses and strains within elements are usually defined at the Gauss points (ideally at the Barlow points) and the node points. The most accurate estimates are at the reduced Gauss points (more specifically the Barlow points). Stresses and strains are usually calculated here and extrapolated to the node points. ENERGY METHODS HAMILTONS PRINCIPLE \uff1a Methods for defining equations of equilibrium and compatibility through consideration of possible variations of the energies of the system. The general form is Hamiltons principle and sub-sets of this are the principle of virtual work including the principle of virtual displacements (PVD) and the principle of virtual forces (PVF). ENGINEERING/MATHEMATICAL NORMALIZATION \uff1a Each eigenvector (mode shape or normal mode) can be multiplied by an arbitrary constant and still satisfy the eigenvalue equation. Various methods of scaling the eigenvector are used Engineering normalization -The vector is scaled so that the largest absolute value of any term in the eigenvector is unity. This is useful for inspecting printed tables of eigenvectors. Mathematical normalization -The vector is scaled so that the diagonal modal mass matrix is the unit matrix. The diagonal modal stiffness matrix is the system eigenvalues. This is useful for response calculations. EQUILIBRIUM EQUATIONS \uff1aInternal forces and external forces must balance. At the infinitesimal level the stresses and the body forces must balance. The equations of equilibrium define these force balance conditions. EQUILIBRIUM FINITE ELEMENTS \uff1a Most of the current finite elements used for structural analysis are defined by assuming displacement variations over the element. An alternative approach assumes the stress variation over the element. This leads to equilibrium finite elements. EQUIVALENT MATERIAL PROPERTIES \uff1a Equivalent material properties are defined where real material properties are smeared over the volume of the element. Typically, for composite materials the discrete fiber and matrix material properties are smeared to give average equivalent material properties. EQUIVALENT STRESS \uff1a A three dimensional solid has six stress components. If material properties have been found experimentally by a uniaxial stress test then the real stress system is related to this by combining the six stress components to a single equivalent stress. There are various forms of equivalent stress for different situations. Common ones are Tresca, Von-Mises, Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager. EULERIAN/LAGRANGIAN METHOD \uff1a For non-linear large deflection problems the equations can be defined in various ways. If the material is flowing though a fixed grid the equations are defined in Eulerian coordinates. Here the volume of the element is constant but the mass in the element can change. If the grid moves with the body then the equations are defined in Lagrangian coordinates. Here the mass in the element is fixed but the volume changes. EXACT SOLUTIONS \uff1a Solutions that satisfy the differential equations and the associated boundary conditions exactly. There are very few such solutions and they are for relatively simple geometries and loadings. EXPLICIT/IMPLICIT METHOD \uff1a These are methods for integrating equations of motion. Explicit methods can deal with highly non-linear systems but need small steps. Implicit methods can deal with mildly nonlinear problems but with large steps. EXTRAPOLATION INTERPOLATION \uff1a The process of estimating a value of a variable from a tabulated set of values. For interpolation values inside the table are estimated. For extrapolation values outside the table are estimated. Interpolation is generally accurate and extrapolation is only accurate for values slightly outside the table. It becomes very inaccurate for other cases. F \u00b6 FACETED GEOMETRY \uff1a If a curved line or surface is modeled by straight lines or flat surfaces then the modeling is said to produce a faceted geometry. FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM \uff1a A method for calculating Fourier transforms that is computationally very efficient. FIELD PROBLEMS \uff1a Problems that can be defined by a set of partial differential equations are field problems. Any such problem can be solved approximately by the finite element method. FINITE DIFFERENCES \uff1a A numerical method for solving partial differential equations by expressing them in a difference form rather than an integral form. Finite difference methods are very similar to finite element methods and in some cases are identical. FINITE ELEMENT MODELING (FEM) \uff1a The process of setting up a model for analysis, typically involving graphical generation of the model geometry, meshing it into finite elements, defining material properties, and applying loads and boundary conditions. FINITE VOLUME METHODS \uff1a A technique related to the finite element method. The equations are integrated approximately using t he weighted residual method, but a different form of weighting function is used from that in the finite element method. For the finite element method the Galerkin form of the weighted residual method is used. FIXED BOUNDARY CONDITIONS \uff1a All degrees of freedom are restrained for this condition. The nodes on the fixed boundary can not move: translation or rotation. FLEXIBILITY MATRIX FORCE METHOD \uff1a The conventional form of the finite element treats the displacements as unknowns, which leads to a stiffness matrix form. Alternative methods treating the stresses (internal forces) as unknowns lead to force methods with an associated flexibility matrix. The inverse of the stiffness matrix is the flexibility matrix. FORCED RESPONSE \uff1a The dynamic motion results from a time varying forcing function. FORCING FUNCTIONS \uff1a The dynamic forces that are applied to the system. FOURIER EXPANSIONS FOURIER SERIES \uff1a Functions that repeat themselves in a regular manner can be expanded in terms of a Fourier series. FOURIER TRANSFORM \uff1a A method for finding the frequency content of a time varying signal. If the signal is periodic it gives the same result as the Fourier series. FOURIER TRANSFORM PAIR \uff1aThe Fourier transform and its inverse which, together, allow the complete system to be transformed freely in either direction between the time domain and the frequency domain. FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS \uff1a If a structure is idealized as a series interconnected line elements then this forms a framework analysis model. If the connections between the line elements a re pins then it is a pin-jointed framework analysis. If the joints are rigid then the lines must be beam elements. FREE VIBRATION \uff1a The dynamic motion which results from specified initial conditions. The forcing function is zero. FREQUENCY DOMAIN \uff1a The structures forcing function and the consequent response is defined in terms of their frequency content. The inverse Fourier transform of the frequency domain gives the corresponding quantity in the time domain. FRONTAL SOLUTION WAVEFRONT SOLUTION \uff1a A form of solving the finite element equations using Gauss elimination that is very efficient for the finite element form of equations. G \u00b6 GAP/CONTACT ELEMENT : These are special forms of non-linear element that have a very high stiffness in compression and a low stiffness in tension. They are used to model contact conditions between surfaces. Most of these elements also contain a model for sliding friction between the contacting surfaces. Some gap elements are just line springs between points and others are more general forms of quadrilateral or brick element elements. The line spring elements should only be used in meshes of first order finite elements. GAUSS POINT EXTRAPOLATION GAUSS POINT STRESSES : Stresses calculated internally within the element at the Gauss integration points are called the Gauss point stresses. These stresses are usually more accurate at these points than the nodal points. GAUSS POINTS GAUSS WEIGHTS : The Gauss points are the sample points used within the elements for the numerical integration of the matrices and loadings. They are also the points at which the stresses can be recovered. The Gauss weights are associated factors used in the numerical integration process. They represent the volume of influence of the Gauss points. The positions of the Gauss points, together with the associated Gauss weights, are available in tables for integrations of polynomials of various orders. GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION : A form of solving a large set of simultaneous equations. Within most finite element systems a form of Gaussian elimination forms the basic solution process. GAUSSIAN INTEGRATION GAUSSIAN QUADRATURE : A form of numerically integrating functions that is especially efficient for integrating polynomials. The functions are evaluated at the Gauss points, multiplied by the Gauss weights and summed to give the integral. GENERALIZED COORDINATES : A set of linearly independent displacement coordinates which are consistent with the constraints and are just sufficient to describe any arbitrary configuration of the system. Generalized coordinates are usually patterns of displacements, typically the system eigenvectors. GENERALIZED MASS : The mass associated with a generalized displacement. GENERALIZED STIFFNESS : The stiffness associated with a generalized displacement. GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES : Various shape dependent properties of real structures, such as thickness, cross sectional area, sectional moments of inertia, centroid location and others that are applied as properties of finite elements. GEOMETRIC/STRESS STIFFNESS : The component of the stiffness matrix that arises from the rotation of the internal stresses in a large deflection problem. This stiffness is positive for tensile stresses and negative for compressive stresses. If the compressive stresses are sufficiently high then the structure will buckle when the geometric stiffness cancels the elastic stiffness. GEOMETRICAL ERRORS : Errors in the geometrical representation of the model. These generally arise from the approximations inherent in the finite element approximation. GLOBAL STIFFNESS MATRIX : The assembled stiffness matrix of the complete structure. GROSS DEFORMATIONS : Deformations sufficiently high to make it necessary to include their effect in the solution process. The problem requires a large deflection non-linear analysis. GOVERNING EQUATIONS : The governing equations for a system are the equations derived from the physics of the system. Many engineering systems can be described by governing equations, which determine the system's characteristics and behaviors. GUARD VECTORS : The subspace iteration (simultaneous vector iteration) method uses extra guard vectors in addition to the number of vectors requested by the user. These guard the desired vectors from being contaminated by the higher mode vectors and speed up convergence.

Supported hardware platforms \u00b6 This document details information about licensing WelSimulation LLC products on the hardware platforms listed below. Linux x64 (linx64) Windows x64 (winx64) For specific operating system requirements, contact the customer support for the product and platform you are running. Conventions used in this document \u00b6 Computer prompts and responses and user input are printed using this font: /welsim_com/shared_files/licensing/welslic_admin Wild card arguments and variables are italicized . Commands appear in bold face. Introduction \u00b6 WelSimulation LLC uses the internal license manager for all of its licensed products. The communication between the WELSIM applications and license manager occurs through an internal process. The communication is nearly transparent; you should not see any noticeable difference in your day-to-day operation of WELSIM products. You do not need to run the license manager installation. The license manager is installed together with the WELSIM application package. The licensing process \u00b6 The licensing process for WELSIM is as follows: Install the software. Start the software and generate your unique Computer ID, send the Computer ID to info@welsim.com . After you receive your license file, run the License Manager Wizard from Toolbar of WELSIM application. Set up the licensing environment and input license. See Activating the WELSIM . Explanation of licensing terms \u00b6 The main components of the licensing are: License file Application program (WELSIM) These components are explained in more detail in the following sections. The license file \u00b6 Licensing data is stored in a text file called the license file. The license file is created by WelSimulation LLC and is installed by the end user. It contains information about the version, signature, and date. The default and recommended location for the WELSIM license file (wsimkey.dat) is in the %APPDATA%/WELSIM directory. The application can automatically place the license file at this location after activation. End users can manually copy the license file to that directory, although are not suggested. License file format \u00b6 License files usually contain eight lines. You cannot modify any these data items in the license files. Note Everything in the license key should be entered exactly as supplied. All data in the license file is case sensitive, unless otherwise indicated. Application line \u00b6 The application line specifies the application name. Normally a license file for WELSIM application uses the \u201c[WELSIM]\u201d. The example of the application line is: [WELSIM] License version line \u00b6 The license version line specifies the version of current license file. The example of the this line is shown below: license_verion = 100 License signature line \u00b6 A license signature line describes the password key to use a product. The example of the signature line is: license_signature = Tvp919deAq5od+nCUjRF15mgeBIKCLgscLgvR8eFYAlBrqqcjETIyuY0Lu/brYbOKYrIPOXqFzWn8asLqieImA== Computer ID line \u00b6 The computer ID line is the string generated from client's computer. The example of the Computer ID line is: client_signature = KXfe-uAAA-KXfe-uQAA Application version lines \u00b6 The application version lines include two parts, one is the start version number and another is the end version. The example of the application version lines are: from_sw_version = 100 to_sw_version = 100 Effective date lines \u00b6 The effective date lines include both start and end date. The example of the effective date lines are: from_date = 2017-07-02 to_date = 2018-08-02 Sample license files \u00b6 A sample license file is shown here. This file is for WELSIM v1.8 and later tasks. [WELSIM] license_version = 100 license_signature = Tvp919deAq5od+nCUjRF15mgeBIKCLgscLgvR8eFYAlBrqqcjETIyuY0Lu/brYbOKYrIPOXqFzWn8asLqieImA== client_signature = KXfe-uAAA-KXfe-uQAA from_sw_version = 100 to_sw_version = 100 from_date = 2017-07-02 to_date = 2018-07-02 Recognizing a WELSIM license file \u00b6 If you receive a license file and are not sure if it is a WELSIM license file, you can determine if it is by looking at the contents of the license file. If it is a WELSIM license file, then In the first line of the license file, the string field is WELSIM. Installing the WELSIM license manager \u00b6 The WelSim License Manager is included in the WELSIM application installation. As the user installs the application, the license manager is already installed. Troubleshooting \u00b6 This section lists problems and error messages that you may encounter while setting up licensing. The possible error messages are: LICENSE_FILE_NOT_FOUND LICENSE_SERVER_NOT_FOUND ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NOT_DEFINED FILE_FORMAT_NOT_RECOGNIZED LICENSE_MALFORMED PRODUCT_NOT_LICENSED PRODUCT_EXPIRED LICENSE_CORRUPTED IDENTIFIERS_MISMATCH An example of the license message error message is shown in Figure [fig:ch10_license_not_found].","title":"WelSim licensing guide"},{"location":"install/licensing/#welsim-licensing-guide","text":"","title":"WELSIM licensing guide"},{"location":"install/licensing/#preface","text":"This document contains information for running the WELSIM License Manager with all WelSimulation LLC products.","title":"Preface"},{"location":"install/licensing/#supported-hardware-platforms","text":"This document details information about licensing WelSimulation LLC products on the hardware platforms listed below.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. Additional Definitions. As used herein, \u201cthis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \u201cGNU GPL\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \u201cThe Library\u201d refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. An \u201cApplication\u201d is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library. A \u201cCombined Work\u201d is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \u201cLinked Version\u201d. The \u201cMinimal Corresponding Source\u201d for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. The \u201cCorresponding Application Code\u201d for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. Conveying Modified Versions. If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version: under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following: Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. Do one of the following: Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) Combined Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following: Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU Lesser General Public License \u00b6 Version 2.1 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: The modified work must itself be a software library. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\\ If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\\noindent This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

As used herein, \u201cthis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \u201cGNU GPL\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \u201cThe Library\u201d refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. An \u201cApplication\u201d is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library. A \u201cCombined Work\u201d is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \u201cLinked Version\u201d. The \u201cMinimal Corresponding Source\u201d for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. The \u201cCorresponding Application Code\u201d for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. Conveying Modified Versions. If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version: under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following: Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. Do one of the following: Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) Combined Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following: Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: The modified work must itself be a software library. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\\ If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\\noindent This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

It is a post-processing calculation, based on already calculated transient magnetic field quantities. It is applicable for the evaluation of core losses in steel laminations (frequently used in applications such as electric machines, transformers) or in power ferrites. Hysteresis loss is associated with loss density fields in 2D and 3D eddy current solutions only. Hysteresis loss is short for magnetic hysteresis loss and represents power loss in some magnetic materials (electric steels or ferrites) in alternating (sinusoidal) magnetic fields. This loss is due to a phenomenon called \"magnetic viscosity\" which causes the B and H fields to have a phase shift between them. In the B-H plane, for linear materials, the relationship between these two fields describes an ellipse. The hysteresis loss is proportional to the area of the ellipse. Core loss models for an electromagnetic material \u00b6 MatEditor provides two core loss models: electrical steel and power ferrite. The coefficients are given in the table below. Type Associated properties Electrical Steel Hystersis coefficient \\(K_h\\) , Classcial eddy coefficient \\(K_c\\) , Excess coefficient \\(K_e\\) . Power Ferrite Steinmetz coefficients \\(C_m\\) , \\(X\\) , and \\(Y\\) . Note In Transient Solver, X must be less than Y. Calculating properties for core loss (B-P curve) \u00b6 To be able to extract parameters from the loss characteristics (B-P Curve), you first set the Core Loss Model of the material to Electrical Steel or Power Ferrite as a material property in the Property View. Additional parameters appear in the following table Core Loss Model ( \\(K_h\\) , \\(K_c\\) , and \\(K_e\\) for electrical steel, and \\(C_{m}\\) , \\(X\\) , and \\(Y\\) for power ferrite). If the P-B test data is already presented in the current material, you can add curve fitting property from the RMB context menu. This allows the electrical steel coefficients \\(K_h\\) , \\(K_c\\) , and \\(K_e\\) , or the power ferrite coefficients \\(C_m\\) , \\(X\\) , and \\(Y\\) to be derived from a manufacturer-provided core loss curve. Node The accuracy in inputting the data for B-P Curve for the electrical steel material has a significant effect on the correctness of the analyses to the electromagnetic devices. You should input the data for B-P Curve according to accurate data provided by material manufacturers. Typically core material suppliers provide the average loss over a cycle for a peak B, of sinusoidal nature. Therefore for BP curve input in WelSim, B (Tesla) should be peak and P should be average. As the input data (value or unit) changes, the following parameters are not automatically updated unless you resolve the curve fitting: \\(K_h\\) - Hysteresis Coefficient \\(K_c\\) - Classical Eddy Coefficient \\(K_e\\) - Excess Coefficient \\(C_m\\) - Steinmetz Coefficient \\(X\\) - Steinmetz Coefficient \\(Y\\) - Steinmetz Coefficient Calculate core loss coefficients from loss curves \u00b6 This section introduces how to calculate core loss coefficients for electrical steel and power ferrite materials according to the given P-B test data. Add P-B Test Data material property, and edit the frequency-based data. You also can import the data from a plain text or Excel file. Check the data curves by clicking the row of frequency. Click the header of the frequency column displays all curves in the chart. Add Core Loss Model material property, and set the Core Loss Model Type of the property to Electrical Steel or Power Ferrite. Add Curve Fitting sub-property from the RMB context menu. Solve the curve fit from the RMB context menu. If the solve succeeds. The calculated parameters will be shown in the table. Copy the solved values to the properties from RMB context menu. You also can review the calculated curves in the chart. Display curves in the logarithmic axis (optional). Computation of electrical steel core loss from loss curves \u00b6 The iron-core loss without DC flux bias is expressed as the following: \\[ p_v=P_h+P_c+P_e=K_{f} f (B_m)^2 + K_c (fB_m)^2 + K_e(fB_m)^{1.5} = K_1B_m^2+K_2B_m^{1.5} \\] where \\(B_m\\) is the amplitude of the AC flux component, \\(f\\) is the frequency, \\(K_h\\) is the hysteresis core loss coefficient, \\(K_c\\) is the eddy-current core loss coefficient, and \\(K_e\\) is the excess core loss coefficient, \\(K_1=K_ff+K_cf^2\\) , \\(K_2=K_ef^{1.5}\\) .

Note Since the manufacturer-provided loss curve is obtained under sinusoidal flux conditions at a given frequency, these coefficients can be derived in the frequency domain. Computation of power ferrite core loss from loss curves \u00b6 The principles of the computation algorithm are summarized as follows. The iron-core loss is expressed as the Steinmetz approximation \\[ p_v=C_m f^x B_m^y \\] where \\(p_v\\) is the average power density, \\(f\\) is the excitation frequency, and \\(B_m\\) is the peak flux density, is commonly used to characterize core loss data for sinusoidal excitation, but can also be applied to square-wave data. To linearize the equation for curve fitting, we used base-10 logarithms. The equation above can be rewritten to \\[ log(p_v)=c + x\\cdot log(f) + y \\cdot(B_m) \\] where \\(c=log(C_m)\\) . Minimize the quadratic form to obtain \\(C\\) , \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) . \\[ err(C_m,x,y)=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}\\left[log(p_{vij})-\\left(c+xlog(f_i)+ylog(B_{mij}) \\right) \\right]^2=min \\] where \\(m\\) is the number of loss curves, \\(n_i\\) is the number of points of the \\(i\\) -th loss curve, and \\(P_{vij} = f(f_i , B_{mij})\\) is two dimensional lookup table for multi-frequency loss curves.

The initial shear modulus is defined: \\[ \\mu=2c_{10} \\] The initial bulk modulus is: \\[ K=\\frac{2}{D_1} \\] Hyperelasticity Material Curve Fitting \u00b6 The mechanical response of hyperelastic materials is determined by the hyperelastic constants in the strain energy density function of a model. To get correct results during a hyperelastic analysis, it is required to precisely assess the material constants of the materials being tested. These constants are usually derived for a material based on the experimental strain-stress data. The test data are generally taken from several modes of deformation over a wide range of strain values. The material constants could be fit using test data in at least as many deformation states as will be experienced in the finite element analysis. For hyperelastic materials, simple deformation tests can be used to characterize the material constants. The six different deformation modes are graphically illustrated in the figure below. Combinations of data from multiple tests will enhance the characterization of the hyperelastic behavior of a material. Although these six different deformation states are accepted, we find that upon the addition of hydrostatic stresses, the following modes of deformation are the same: Uniaxial Tension and Equibiaxial Compression. Uniaxial Compression and Equibiaxial Tension. Planar Tension and Planar Compression. With these equivalent modes of testing, we now have only three independent deformation modes for which one can get experimental data. In the analysis, when the coordinate system is chosen to consistent with the principal directions of deformation, the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor can be written in matrix form by: \\[ [C] = \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda_1^2 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2^2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] where \\(\\lambda_i\\) =1+ \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is principal stretch ratio in the i -th direction, \\(epsilon_i\\) is principal value of the engineering strain tensor in the i -th direction. The principal invariants of right Cauchy-Green strain tensor \\(C_{ij}\\) are: \\[ I_1 = \\lambda_1^2+\\lambda_2^2+\\lambda_3^2 \\] \\[ I_2 = \\lambda_1^2\\lambda_2^2 + \\lambda_1^2\\lambda_3^2 + \\lambda_2^2\\lambda_3^2 \\] \\[ I_3 = \\lambda_1^2\\lambda_2^2\\lambda_3^2 \\] For the fully incompressible material, the principal invariant \\(I_3\\) is one: \\[ \\lambda_1^2\\lambda_2^2\\lambda_3^2=1 \\] Uniaxial tension (Equibiaxial compression) \u00b6 For the uniaxial tension deformation, the principal stretch ratios in the directions orthogonal to the 'pulling' axis is identical. Thus, the principal stretches during uniaxial tension \\(\\lambda_i\\) are given by: \\(\\lambda_1=\\) stretch in direction being loaded \\(\\lambda_2=\\lambda_3=\\) stretch in directions not being loaded Due to incompressibility: \\[ \\lambda_2\\lambda_3=\\lambda^{-1} \\] and with \\[ \\lambda_2=\\lambda_3=\\lambda_1^{-1/2} \\] For uniaxial tension, the first and second strain invariants then become: \\[ I_1= \\lambda_1^2+2\\lambda_1^{-1}\\\\ I_2=2\\lambda_1+\\lambda_1^{-2} \\] The corresponding engineering stress can be expressed using principal stretch ratio: \\[ T_1=2(\\lambda_1-\\lambda_1^{-2})[\\dfrac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_1}+\\lambda_1^{-1}\\dfrac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_2}] \\] Equibiaxial tension (Uniaxial compression) \u00b6 During an equibiaxial tension test, the principal stretch ratios in the directions being loaded are identical. Therefore, for quibiaxial tension, the principal stretches, \\(\\lambda_i\\) are given by: \\(\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2=\\) stretch ratio in direction being loaded \\(\\lambda_3=\\) stretch in directions not being loaded According to incompressibility, we have \\[ \\lambda_3=\\lambda_1^{-2} \\] For equibiaxial tension, the first and second strain invariants then become: \\[ I_1=2\\lambda_1^2+\\lambda_1^{-4} \\\\ I_2=\\lambda_1^4+2\\lambda_1^{-2} \\] The corresponding engineering stress can be expressed using principal stretch ratio: \\[ T_1=2(\\lambda_1-\\lambda_1^{-5})[\\dfrac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_1} + \\lambda_1^2\\dfrac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_2}] \\] Pure Shear (Uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression in orthogonal directions) \u00b6 For pure shear deformation mode, plane strain is generally assumed so that there is no deformation in the 'wide' direction of the specimen. Including the incompressibility, we have \\[ \\lambda_2=1 \\\\ \\lambda_3 = \\lambda_1^{-1} \\] For pure shear, the first and second strain invariants are: \\[ I_1=I_2=\\lambda_1^2+\\lambda_1^{-2}+1 \\] The corresponding engineering stress can be expressed using principal stretch ratio: \\[ T_1=2(\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_1^{-3})[\\dfrac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_1} + \\dfrac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_2}] \\] Volumetric Deformation \u00b6 The volumetric deformation is given as: \\[ \\lambda_1=\\lambda_2=\\lambda_3=\\lambda\\\\ J=\\lambda^3 \\] As nearly incompressible is assumed, we have: \\[ \\lambda \\approx 1 \\] The pressure P is directly related to the volume ratio J: \\[ P=\\dfrac{\\partial W}{\\partial J} \\] Deformations for principal stretches based models \u00b6 For the models based on the principal stretches, such Ogden model, the strain-stress relation can be obtained by deriving the strain energy with respect to the stretch. \\[ \\sigma(\\lambda)=\\dfrac{\\partial W(\\lambda)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\] The corresponding engineering stress is: \\[ T_1 = \\dfrac{\\partial W(\\lambda_1)}{\\partial \\lambda_1} \\lambda_1^{-1} \\] Material stability check \u00b6 Stability checks are critical for the following analysis. A nonlinear material is stable if the secondary work required for an arbitrary change in the deformation is always positive. We usually use the Drucker stability criterion to determine the stability of the hyperelastic materials. Mathematically, this is: \\[ d\\sigma_{ij}d\\epsilon_{ij}>0 \\] where \\(d\\sigma\\) is the change in the Cauchy stress tensor corresponding to a change in the logarithmic strain. The material stability checks can be done at the end of preprocessing but before an analysis actually begins. Checking for the stability of a material can be more conveniently accomplished by checking for the positive definiteness of the material stiffness. The program checks for the loss of stability of six typical stress paths including uniaxial tension and compression, equibiaxial tension and compression, and planar tension and compression. the range of the stretch ratio over which the stability is checked is chosen from 0.1 to 10. Calculate material constants from test data \u00b6 This section introduces how to calculate material coefficients for the selected hyperelastic models according to the given uniaxial, biaxial, shear, and volumetric test data. Add Uniaxial Test Data, Biaxial Test Data, or Shear Test Data material property, and edit the strain-stress data. You also can import the data from a plain text or Excel file. Set the temperature value if it is available. Check the data points by clicking the row of temperature. Add one of hyperelastic material properties from the toolbox, the supported hyperelastic models include Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Arruda-Boyce, Blatz-Ko, Gent, Ogden, Polynomial, and Yeoh. An example of Mooney-Rivlin 9 is given here. Add Curve Fitting sub-property from the RMB context menu. Solve the curve fit from the RMB context menu. If the solve succeeds. The calculated parameters will be shown in the table. Copy the solved values to the properties from RMB context menu. You also can review the calculated curves in the chart. Note The test data should cover the entire strain range in the following simulation. It is recommended to input all uniaxial, biaxial, and shear test data if those data are available from the experiments.","title":"Hyperelasticity and curve fitting"},{"location":"mateditor/mat_hyperelasticity_curvefit/#hyperelasticity-and-curve-fitting","text":"","title":"Hyperelasticity and Curve Fitting"},{"location":"mateditor/mat_hyperelasticity_curvefit/#isotropic-hyperelasticity","text":"The elastic potential energy in hyperelastic material can be obtained from the initial state with no stress activation.

To get correct results during a hyperelastic analysis, it is required to precisely assess the material constants of the materials being tested. These constants are usually derived for a material based on the experimental strain-stress data. The test data are generally taken from several modes of deformation over a wide range of strain values. The material constants could be fit using test data in at least as many deformation states as will be experienced in the finite element analysis. For hyperelastic materials, simple deformation tests can be used to characterize the material constants. The six different deformation modes are graphically illustrated in the figure below. Combinations of data from multiple tests will enhance the characterization of the hyperelastic behavior of a material. Although these six different deformation states are accepted, we find that upon the addition of hydrostatic stresses, the following modes of deformation are the same: Uniaxial Tension and Equibiaxial Compression. Uniaxial Compression and Equibiaxial Tension. Planar Tension and Planar Compression. With these equivalent modes of testing, we now have only three independent deformation modes for which one can get experimental data. In the analysis, when the coordinate system is chosen to consistent with the principal directions of deformation, the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor can be written in matrix form by: \\[ [C] = \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda_1^2 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2^2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] where \\(\\lambda_i\\) =1+ \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is principal stretch ratio in the i -th direction, \\(epsilon_i\\) is principal value of the engineering strain tensor in the i -th direction.

Overview \u00b6 Material Module serves as a database for material properties used in a modeling project. The module not only provides a material library but also allow you to create a material using the given properties. The spreadsheet of a Material object is the primary user interface designed to let you create, save, and retrieve material models. The well-defined material object can be saved and used in the subsequent projects. Material Module is shown as a Material Project and Material Objects in the Project Explorer (tree) window. The solution system contains only one Material Project, which acts as a material repository in the modeling system. The Material Project may include multiple Material Objects, where the properties can be added or edited by users. To access Material Object properties, you can choose one of the following methods: * Double click on the Material Object . * Right click on a Material Object , and select Edit item from the context menu. Modes of operation \u00b6 Material for subsequent analysis : You can create a material that can be consumed in the subsequent analysis. For example, a defined material can be assigned to the specific geometry bodies. Material Data for files : You can create a material and export the material data into an external file. The data included in the Material Module is automatically saved as you save the project. User interface \u00b6 The Material Editor spreadsheet is an essential portion of the WELSIM user interface, and it displays material-related components that allow users to edit material data easily. Editing mode \u00b6 Presented in this section are two configurations for the material property editing. The first configuration method is based on the library as shown in Figure [fig:ch3_guide_mat_ui_lib], and the second configuration is designed to manually combine the properties for the material object as shown in Figure [fig:ch3_guide_mat_ui_build]. You can click on the Library or Build tab to switch these two editing modes. Note You can click on category tabs to browse different materials. Loading a material dataset from the library removes all pre-existing properties. Build outline tab \u00b6 The Build Outline Tab shows an outline of the contents of the togglable material properties. You can add a property data entry to the material by toggling on the property entry or remove property by toggling off the property entry. Properties pane \u00b6 The Properties pane displays all properties that are going to be added to the Material Object . You can tune the property values at this pane. The columns in this spreadsheet pane are: Name : A read-only text field to display the property name. Value : A number field to display and input the value. Description : A read-only text field to display the attribute of this property. You can delete a property by right-clicking on a row and select Remove Rows from the pop-up context menu. The Material Properties pane provides the following command buttons to the bottom of the window: OK : Save the properties and exit the material editor. Apply : Save the current properties to the material database. Cancel : Exit the material editor without Saving. Clear : Remove all properties. Working with material data \u00b6 Exporting \u00b6 You can export the complete material data to an external file. The following format is supported for export: JSON in WELSIM Material schema. To implement the exporting, you can use one of the following methods: Click the Export Materials button from the standard Toolbar . Click the Export Materials item from the Material Menu . Right-click the Material Project and select the Export Materials item from the context menu. MatEditor applicaiton \u00b6 MatEditor is a free application allow you to create and edit material data for the computer aided engineering.

Boundary condition display \u00b6 For the boundary conditions, the Graphics window displays the highlighted entities (faces, edges, vertices), the Property View, Tabular Data, and Chart windows show the boundary values over time. The Properties View window also allows you to scope the geometry entities and set values, as shown in Figure below. . Solution display \u00b6 After solving, the user interface displays the solution and results. The Graphics window displays the result contour and legend. The Properties View shows the Maximum and Minimum values of the result at the given Set Number. The Tabular Data and Chart Windows illustrate the maximum and minimum values over the time as shown in Figure below. . Result legend \u00b6 You can adjust the result contour and legend by right clicking on the legend field and set the parameters in the context menu, as shown in Figure below. . Workflow \u00b6 Using WELSIM is straightforward. The following gives you the primary workflow steps in starting a finite element analysis project from scratch: Create a new project \u00b6 Clicking New command from Toolbar or File Menu creates a new simulation project. Several default objects are automatically generated in the tree, and the Graphics window is filled with the 3D modeling interface. The following shows the behaviors of creating a new project: A Material Project and a FEM Project are created simultaneously. The Material Project object holds only Material objects , and the FEM Project object contains all modeling objects that allow users to customize a finite element analysis. Only one Material Project is allowed in the tree, while you can add multiple FEM Projects to conduct multiple simulation studies at one interface. An activated project displays the object name in Bold . You can double click the project object to activate a FEM Project . Many commands on Toolbar and Menu become available as a FEM project is created. Each object provides a unique context menu, and you can right-click to display the context menu. For example, you can rename an object via the context menu. Each object provides unique options in Properties View window, which is automatically updated as you select objects. Defining materials \u00b6 In addition to the default Structural Steel material, you can add new materials and define the properties. A Material object represents a material database. The following gives the behaviors of material definition. You can create a new material object by clicking Add Material command from Toolbar or Material Menu . The Material Project many holds multiple Material objects. A newly created Material object requires you to specify the properties. Double-clicking or right-clicking on the material object, you open the Edit spreadsheet. Two methods are available for you to add material properties in the Edit spreadsheet.

The ruler in the Graphics window provides you a reference to estimate the size of geometries. The size of the imported geometry can be adjusted by the tuning the Scale property value. Meshing \u00b6 You can skip meshing at this moment because the system automatically meshes the domain at solving step if no mesh is generated. However, meshing at this step provides you an insight of the mesh quality and a chance to optimize the mesh. You can click the Mesh commands from the Toolbar or FEM Menu to perform the meshing operations. The mesh module supports Tet10 , Tet4 , Tri6 , and Tri3 elements. The default type is the linear element, and you can change the element order by modifying the Quadratic property in Mesh Settings object.

Edge-element magnetic vector potential \u00b6 Due to the limitation of node-based vector magnetic potential algorithm 2 , WELSIM application uses the edge-based finite element for the magnetic vector potential algorithm. The governing equation for the edge finite element method is given below. \\[ \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{v}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A}+\\sigma\\left\\{ \\dfrac{\\partial\\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}+\\nabla V\\right\\} +\\epsilon\\left(\\left\\{ \\dfrac{\\partial^{2}\\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t^{2}}\\right\\} +\\nabla\\left\\{ \\dfrac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}\\right\\} \\right)=\\mathbf{0} \\] \\[ \\nabla\\cdot\\left(\\sigma\\left(\\left\\{ \\dfrac{\\partial\\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}\\right\\} +\\nabla V\\right)+\\epsilon\\left(\\left\\{ \\dfrac{\\partial^{2}\\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t^{2}}\\right\\} +\\nabla\\left\\{ \\dfrac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}\\right\\} \\right)\\right)=\\mathbf{0} \\] \\[ \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{v}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{J}_{s}+\\nabla\\times\\dfrac{1}{\\mathbf{v}_{0}}\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{M}_{0} \\] The uniqueness of these equations is ensured by the tree gauging procedure, which sets the edge-flux degrees of freedom related to the spanning tree of the finite element mesh to zero.

The relationship is also path-dependent (except for the case of nonlinear elasticity and hyperelasticity), so that the stress depends on the strain history as well as the strain itself. The program can account for many material nonlinearities, as follows: Rate-independent plasticity is characterized by the irreversible instantaneous straining that occurs in a material. Rate-dependent plasticity allows the plastic-strains to develop over a time interval. It is also termed viscoplasticity. Creep is also an irreversible straining that occurs in a material and is rate-dependent so that the strains develop over time. The time frame for creep is usually much larger than that for rate-dependent plasticity. Nonlinear elasticity allows a nonlinear stress-strain relationship to be specified. All straining is reversible. Hyperelasticity is defined by a strain-energy density potential that characterizes elastomeric and foam-type materials. All straining is reversible. Viscoelasticity is a rate-dependent material characterization that includes a viscous contribution to the elastic straining. When the material applicable for analysis is an elastoplastic material, the updated Lagrange method is applied, and the total Lagrange method is applied for hyperelastic material. Moreover, the Newton-Raphson method is applied to the repetitive analysis method. Strain definitions \u00b6 For the case of nonlinear materials, the definition of elastic strain given in Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:ch4_theory_stress_strain_relation}\\) expands to \\[ \\begin{align} \\label{eq:ch4_guide_strain_full} \\{\\epsilon\\}=\\{\\epsilon^{el}\\}+\\{\\epsilon^{th}\\}+\\{e^{pl}\\}+\\{\\epsilon^{cr}\\}+\\{\\epsilon^{sw}\\} \\end{align} \\] where \\(\\epsilon\\) is the total strain vector, \\(\\epsilon^{el}\\) is elastic strain vector, \\(\\epsilon^{th}\\) is the thermal strain vector, \\(\\epsilon^{pl}\\) is the plastic strain vector, \\(\\epsilon^{cr}\\) is the creep strain vector, and \\(\\epsilon^{sw}\\) is the swelling strain vector. Hyperelasticity \u00b6 The elastic potential energy in hyperelastic material can be obtained from the initial state with no stress activation. Therefore, we have the main invariable terms of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor C( \\(I_{1}\\) , \\(I_{2}\\) , \\(I_{3}\\) ), or the main invariable of the deformation tensor excluding the volume changes ( \\(\\bar{I}_{1}\\) , \\(\\bar{I}_{2}\\) , \\(\\bar{I}_{3}\\) ). The potential can be expressed as \\(\\mathbf{W}=\\mathbf{W}(I_{1},I_{2},I_{3})\\) , or \\(\\mathbf{W}=\\mathbf{W}(\\bar{I}_{1},\\bar{I}_{2},\\bar{I}_{3})\\) . The nonlinear constitutive relation of hyperelastic material is defined by the relation between the second order Piola-Kirchhoff stress and the Green-Lagrange strain, the total Lagrange method is more efficient in solving such models. When the elastic potential energy \\(W\\) of the hyperelasticity is known, the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress and strain-stress relationship can be calculated as follows \\[ S=2\\dfrac{\\partial W}{\\partial C} \\] \\[ C=4\\dfrac{\\partial^{2}W}{\\partial C\\partial C} \\] Arruda-Boyce model \u00b6 The form of the strain-energy potential for Arruda-Boyce model is \\[ \\begin{array}{ccc} W & = & [\\dfrac{1}{2}(\\bar{I}_{1}-3)+\\dfrac{1}{20\\lambda_{m}^{2}}(\\bar{I_{1}^{2}}-9)+\\dfrac{11}{1050\\lambda_{m}^{4}}(\\bar{I_{1}^{3}}-27)\\\\ & + & \\dfrac{19}{7000\\lambda_{m}^{6}}(\\bar{I_{1}^{4}}-81)+\\dfrac{519}{673750\\lambda_{m}^{8}}(\\bar{I_{1}^{5}}-243)]+\\dfrac{1}{D_1}(\\dfrac{J^{2}-1}{2}-\\mathrm{ln}J) \\end{array} \\] where \\(\\lambda_{m}\\) is limiting network stretch, and \\(D_1\\) is the material incompressibility parameter.

Since condition F=0 holds during the plastic deformation, we have \\[ \\begin{align} \\label{eq:ch5_plastic_gov1} \\dot{F}=\\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial\\sigma}\\colon\\dot{\\sigma}+\\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial\\mathbf{e}^{p}}\\colon\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}^{p}=0 \\end{align} \\] where \\(\\dot{F}\\) is the time derivative function of \\(F\\) . In this case, we assume the existence of the plastic potential \\(\\Theta\\) , the plastic strain rate is \\[ \\dot{\\mathbf{e}}^{p}=\\dot{\\lambda}\\dfrac{\\partial\\Theta}{\\partial\\sigma} \\] where \\(\\dot{\\lambda}\\) is the factor. Moreover, assuming the plastic potential \\(\\Theta\\) is equivalent to yield function \\(F\\) , the associated flow rule is assumed as \\[ \\dot{\\mathbf{e}}^{p}=\\dot{\\lambda}\\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial\\sigma} \\] which is substituted with equation \\(\\eqref{eq:ch5_plastic_gov1}\\) , we have \\[ \\dot{\\lambda}=\\dfrac{\\mathbf{a}^{T}\\colon\\mathbf{d}_{D}}{A+\\mathbf{a}^{T}\\colon\\mathbf{D}\\colon\\mathbf{a}}\\mathbf{\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}} \\] where \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is the elastic matrix, and \\[ \\mathbf{a}^{T}=\\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial\\sigma}\\quad\\mathbf{d}_{D}=\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{a}^{T}\\quad A=-\\dfrac{1}{\\dot{\\lambda}}\\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial\\mathbf{\\mathbf{e}}^{p}}\\colon\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}^{p} \\] The stress-strain relation for elastoplasicity can be rewritten to \\[ \\begin{align} \\label{eq:ch5_plastic_yield_func1} \\dot{\\sigma}=\\{\\mathbf{D}-\\dfrac{\\mathbf{d}_{D}\\otimes\\mathbf{d}_{D}^{T}}{A+\\mathbf{d}_{D}^{T}\\mathbf{a}}\\}\\colon\\dot{\\mathbf{e}} \\end{align} \\] Here we give the explicit form of several yield functions that are applied in the program. Von-Mises yield function \u00b6 \\[ F=\\sqrt{3\\mathbf{J}_{2}}-\\sigma_{y} = 0 \\] Mohr-Coulomb yield function \u00b6 \\[ F=\\sigma_{1}-\\sigma_{3}+(\\sigma_{1}+\\sigma_{3})\\mathrm{sin}\\phi-2c\\mathrm{cos}\\phi = 0 \\] Drucker-Prager yield function \u00b6 \\[ F=\\sqrt{\\mathbf{J}_{2}}-\\alpha\\sigma\\colon\\mathbf{I}-\\sigma_{y}=0 \\] where material constant \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\sigma_{y}\\) are calculated from the viscosity and friction angle of the material as shown below \\[ \\alpha=\\dfrac{2\\mathrm{sin}\\phi}{3+\\mathrm{sin}\\phi},\\quad\\sigma_{y}=\\dfrac{6c\\mathrm{cos}\\phi}{3+\\mathrm{sin}\\phi} \\] Viscoelasticity \u00b6 A material is viscoelastic if the material has both elastic (recoverable) and viscous (nonrecoverable) parts. Upon loads, the elastic deformation is instantaneous while the viscous part occurs over time. A viscoelastic model can depicts the deformation behavior of glass or glass-like materials and simulate heating and cooling processing of such materials. Constitutive Equations \u00b6 A generalized Maxwell model is applied for viscoelasticity in this program. The constitutive equation becomes a function of deviatoric strain \\(\\mathbf{e}\\) and deviatoric viscosity strain \\(\\mathbf{q}\\) , \\[ \\sigma(t)=K\\thinspace tr(\\epsilon\\mathbf{I})+2G(\\mu_{0}\\mathbf{e}+\\mu\\mathbf{q}) \\] where \\[ \\mu\\mathbf{q}=\\sum_{m=1}^{M}\\mu_{m}\\mathbf{q}^{(m)};\\quad\\sum_{m=0}^{M}\\mu_{m}=1 \\] moveover, the deviatoric viscosity strain \\(\\mathbf{q}\\) can be calculated by \\[ \\dot{\\mathbf{q}}\\thinspace^{(m)}+\\dfrac{1}{\\tau_{m}}\\mathbf{q}^{(m)}=\\dot{\\mathbf{e}} \\] where \\(\\tau_{m}\\) is the relaxation time. The shear and volumetric relaxation coefficient \\(G\\) is represented by the following Prony series: \\[ G(t)=G[\\mu_{0}^{G}+\\sum_{i=1}^{M}\\mu_{i}^{G}e^{-(t/\\tau_{i}^{G})}] \\] \\[ K(t)=K[\\mu_{0}^{K}+\\sum_{i=1}^{M}\\mu_{i}^{K} e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}^{K}}}] \\] where \\(\\tau_{i}^{G}\\) and \\(\\tau_{i}^{K}\\) are relaxation times for each Prony component, \\(G_i\\) and \\(K_i\\) are shear and volumetric moduli, respectively. Themorheological Simplicity \u00b6 Viscous material depends strongly on temperature. For instance, A glass-like material turninto viscous fluids at high temperatures and behave like a solid material at low temperatures. The thermorheological simplicity is proposed to assumes that material response to a load at a high temperature over a short duration is identical to that at lower temperature but over a longer duration. Essentially, the relaxation times in Prony components oby the scaling law: \\[ \\tau_{i}^{G}(T) = \\dfrac{\\tau_{i}^{G}(T_r)}{A(T,T_r)} ,\\qquad \\tau_{i}^{K}(T) = \\dfrac{\\tau_{i}^{K}(T_r)}{A(T,T_r)} \\] where \\(A(T,T_r)\\) is called the shift function. Shift Functions \u00b6 WELSIM offers the following forms of the shift function: Williams-Landel-Ferry Shift Function Williams-Landel-Ferry Shift Function \u00b6 The Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) shift function is defined by \\[ log_{10}(A) = \\dfrac{C1(T-T_r)}{C2+T-T_r} \\] where T is temperature, \\(T_r\\) is reference temperature, \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) are the WLF constants. Rate-dependent plasticity (including creep and viscoplasticity) \u00b6 The creep is a deformation phenomenon that the displacement depends on the time even under constant stress condition. The viscoelasticity can be viewed as linear creep. Several nonlinear creep are described in this section. In the mathematical theory, we define creep strain \\(\\epsilon^{c}\\) and creep strain rate \\(\\dot{\\epsilon}^{c}\\) \\[ \\begin{align} \\label{eq:ch5_creep_gov1} \\dot{\\epsilon}^{c}=\\dfrac{\\partial\\epsilon^{c}}{\\partial t}=\\beta(\\sigma,\\epsilon^{c}) \\end{align} \\] In this case, if the instantaneous strain is assumed as the elasticity strain \\(\\epsilon^{e}\\) , the total strain can be expressed as the summary of elastic and creep strains \\[ \\epsilon=\\epsilon^{e}+\\epsilon^{c} \\] where the elastic strain can be calculated by \\[ \\epsilon^{e}=\\mathbf{c}^{e-1}\\colon\\sigma \\] When the creep occurs in the deformation, the stress becomes \\[ \\sigma_{n+1}=\\mathbf{c}\\colon(\\epsilon_{n+1}-\\epsilon_{n+1}^{c}) \\] \\[ \\epsilon_{n+1}^{c}=\\epsilon_{n}^{c}+\\triangle t\\beta_{n+\\theta} \\] where \\(\\beta_{n+\\theta}\\) becomes \\[ \\beta_{n+\\theta}=(1+\\theta)\\beta_{n}+\\theta\\beta_{n+1} \\] The incremental creep strain \\(\\triangle\\epsilon^{c}\\) can be simplified to a nonlinear equation \\[ \\mathbf{R}_{n+1}=\\epsilon_{n+1}-\\mathbf{c}^{-1}\\colon\\sigma_{n+1}-\\epsilon_{n}^{c}-\\triangle t\\beta_{n+\\theta}=0 \\] The Newton-Raphson method is applied to solve the nonlinear conditions. The iterative scheme in the finite element framework is \\[ \\begin{align} \\label{eq:ch5_creep_gov2} \\mathbf{R}_{n+1}^{(k+1)}=0=\\mathbf{R}_{n+1}^{(k)}-(\\mathbf{c}^{-1}+\\triangle t\\mathbf{c}_{n+1}^{c})d\\sigma_{n+1}^{(k)} \\end{align} \\] which yields \\[ \\begin{align} \\label{eq:ch5_creep_gov3} \\mathbf{c}_{n+1}^{c}=\\dfrac{\\partial\\beta}{\\partial\\sigma}\\mid_{n+\\theta}=\\theta\\dfrac{\\partial\\beta}{\\partial\\sigma}\\mid_{n+1} \\end{align} \\] The above equations \\(\\eqref{eq:ch5_creep_gov2}\\) and \\(\\eqref{eq:ch5_creep_gov3}\\) are used in the iterative scheme. As the residual \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) gets close to zero, the stress \\(\\sigma_{n+1}\\) and tangent tensile modulus are \\[ \\mathbf{c}_{n+1}^{*}=[\\mathbf{c}^{-1}+\\triangle t\\mathbf{c}_{n+1}^{c}]^{-1} \\] To solve the equation \\(\\eqref{eq:ch5_creep_gov1}\\) , the following Norton model is applied in the program. The equivalent clip strain \\(\\dot{\\epsilon}^{cr}\\) is defined to be the function of Mises stress \\(q\\) and time \\(t\\) . \\[ \\dot{\\epsilon}^{cr}=Aq^{n}t^{m} \\] where \\(A\\) , \\(m\\) , \\(n\\) are the material coefficients. Creep \u00b6 Creep is the inelastic, irreversible deformation of structures during time. It is a life limiting factor and depends on stress, strain, temperature and time. This dependency can be modeled as followed: \\[ \\dot{\\epsilon}^{cr}=f(\\sigma,\\epsilon,T,t) \\] Creep can occur in all crystalline materials, such as metal or glass, has various impacts on the behavior of the material. Three types of creep \u00b6 Creep can be divided in three different stages: primary creep, secondary creep and irradiation induced creep. Primary creep (0<m<1) starts rapidly with an infinite creep rate at the initialization. Here is m the time index. It occurs after a certain amount of time and slows down constantly. It occurs in the first hour after applying the load and is essential in calculating the relaxation over time. Secondary creep (m=1) follows right after the primary creep stage. The strain rate is now constant over a long period of time. The strain rate in the irradiation induced creep stage is growing rapidly until failure. This happens in a short period of time and is not of great interest. Therefore only primary and secondary creep are modeled in WelSim. Creep models \u00b6 WELSIM supports implicit creep models including Strain Hardening, Time Hardening, Generalized Exponentia, Generalized Graham, Generalized Blackburn, Modified Time Hardening, Modified Strain Hardening, Generalized Garofalo, Exponential form, Norton, Combined Time Hardening, Rational polynomial, and Generalized Time Hardening. The details of these models are given in the table below.

The relationship is also path-dependent (except for the case of nonlinear elasticity and hyperelasticity), so that the stress depends on the strain history as well as the strain itself. The program can account for many material nonlinearities, as follows: Rate-independent plasticity is characterized by the irreversible instantaneous straining that occurs in a material. Rate-dependent plasticity allows the plastic-strains to develop over a time interval. It is also termed viscoplasticity. Creep is also an irreversible straining that occurs in a material and is rate-dependent so that the strains develop over time. The time frame for creep is usually much larger than that for rate-dependent plasticity. Nonlinear elasticity allows a nonlinear stress-strain relationship to be specified. All straining is reversible. Hyperelasticity is defined by a strain-energy density potential that characterizes elastomeric and foam-type materials. All straining is reversible. Viscoelasticity is a rate-dependent material characterization that includes a viscous contribution to the elastic straining. When the material applicable for analysis is an elastoplastic material, the updated Lagrange method is applied, and the total Lagrange method is applied for hyperelastic material. Moreover, the Newton-Raphson method is applied to the repetitive analysis method.","title":"Structures with material nonlinearities"},{"location":"welsim/theory/materialnl/#strain-definitions","text":"For the case of nonlinear materials, the definition of elastic strain given in Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:ch4_theory_stress_strain_relation}\\) expands to \\[ \\begin{align} \\label{eq:ch4_guide_strain_full} \\{\\epsilon\\}=\\{\\epsilon^{el}\\}+\\{\\epsilon^{th}\\}+\\{e^{pl}\\}+\\{\\epsilon^{cr}\\}+\\{\\epsilon^{sw}\\} \\end{align} \\] where \\(\\epsilon\\) is the total strain vector, \\(\\epsilon^{el}\\) is elastic strain vector, \\(\\epsilon^{th}\\) is the thermal strain vector, \\(\\epsilon^{pl}\\) is the plastic strain vector, \\(\\epsilon^{cr}\\) is the creep strain vector, and \\(\\epsilon^{sw}\\) is the swelling strain vector.","title":"Strain definitions"},{"location":"welsim/theory/materialnl/#hyperelasticity","text":"The elastic potential energy in hyperelastic material can be obtained from the initial state with no stress activation.

Contact pairs \u00b6 Contact Pairs are applied when two separate parts (solid, surface, and line bodies) in an assembly touch one another (they are mutually tangent). The contact bodies/surfaces: Transmit normal forces and tangential frictional forces. Can be bonded contact (Linear). Can separate or collide (Nonlinear). Do not penetrate one another in the structures. As shown in Figure below, the Contact for structure analysis support three types of contact: Bonded , Frictionless , and Frictional .

An assembly model may contain one or multiple parts. There is no limit of parts in WELSIM application, and large assemblie require more hardware resources to process the geometric operations. All parts object are grouped in the Geometry Group object. Working with parts \u00b6 The part has these attributes: Each part object has a Material property, which determines the assigned material on the part. Parts can be hidden/shown in the Graphics window. Parts can be Suppressed/Unsuppressed for the successive analysis. The imported part can adjust the size of geometry by tuning the Scale property value. Color scheme of parts \u00b6 The geometry is assigned with predefined random color. However, you can define the color of part to visually identify different components in an assembly. Click the Display tab from the Properties view of the Part Object, and click the Color By property to determine the color scheme. The following lists the available color schemes: Part Color Material You can reset the colors back to the default color scheme by right click on the Geometry object in the tree and selecting Reset Body Colors . Overview \u00b6 The WELSIM geometry module's interface is similar to that most other features. The graphical user interface of geometry commands is consist of three regions: Toolbars : Located at the top of the interface, there is a toolbar. Geometry Menu : Located at the Menu, the Geometry Menu provides all geometry related commands. Context Menu : Popped up at Geometry tree objects, the context menu provides geometry related commands as shown in Figure below. Creating primitive geometry \u00b6 The system provides built-in commands to allow you to create primitive geometries. The following describes the supported geometries: Box , Cylinder , Plate , and Line . Box \u00b6 An example of a created box shape is shown in Figure [fig:ch3_guide_geom_box]. Cylinder \u00b6 An example of a created cylinder shape is shown in Figure [fig:ch3_guide_geom_cylinder]. Plate \u00b6 An example of a created plate shape is shown in Figure [fig:ch3_guide_geom_plate]. Line \u00b6 An example of a created Line shape is shown in Figure [fig:ch3_guide_geom_line]. Importing and exporting geometry \u00b6 Importing \u00b6 The geometry importing feature supports the STEP and IGES format files, and the STEP file is recommended. The following lists the behaviors of importing geometry: An imported STEP file may lead to creating multiple Part objects in the tree if the file contains an assembly. IGES file contains the surface information only, you need to implement Make Solid command to the imported geometry to obtain the solid geometry. Using the Scale property to tune the size of the imported geometry. Exporting \u00b6 The geometries in the tree can be exported to an external STEP file. The following methods show you how to export: Click the Export ... button from the Toolbar. Click the Export ... item from the Geometry Menu. Right click on the target geometries and select the Export ... from the context menu. Boolean operations \u00b6 The WELSIM geometry module supports fundamental Boolean operations, which allow users to manipulate the shape of geometries. The available operations are Union , Intersection , and Difference . You can select multiple geometry objects from the tree list and press the Boolean commands to implement the operations. You can hold Ctrl or Shift keys to select multiple geometry objects from the project tree. Union \u00b6 The union operation consolidates two or more geometry into one geometry. An example of Union geometry of a box and cylinder shape is shown in Figure below. Intersection \u00b6 The intersection operation keeps the commonly shared portions of two or more geometries. An example of Intersection geometry of a box and cylinder shape is shown in Figure below. Difference \u00b6 The Difference operation subtracts the secondly selected geometry from the first selected geometry. Thus the selection order plays an important role in the final generated geometry. You can see the results of two different selection orders in Figures below. Geometry commands \u00b6 In addition to the fundamental geometry commands, the following lists the commands that may be applied in the geometry modeling: Generate solid \u00b6 In the most of analysis, the model needs to be solid to generate the 3D solid finite element. If the imported geometry only contains the surface data, the mesher cannot generate solid elements. In this scenario, you need to convert a surface geometry to solid geometry. The Generate Solid command provides you with a tool to complete this conversion. To convert a surface to solid geometry, you can follow the steps below: Select the surface geometry objects from the tree. Click the Generate Solid command from the Geometry Menu, or right click on the selected geometry objects, and select the Generate Solid command from the context menu. Part structure types \u00b6 Solid bodies \u00b6 The solid bodies including parts and assembly support all simulation features of WELSIM application. Surface bodies \u00b6 The surface bodies are treated as Shell structure in the structural and thermal analyses.

Those windows appear by default or when specific options are activated. The availability of those windows is controlled by the VIEW \u202f>\u202f Windows menu. This section discusses the following windows: Project Explorer (Tree list) Properties View Graphics Window Output Window Tabular Data Window Chart Window Spreadsheet Window As the user selects a tree object in the Project Explorer window, all attributes for the selected object in Properties View, Tabular Data, and Chart Window are displayed or updated. The Properties window contains two tabs, and the Data tab shows the attributes about the object data, the Display tab lists the specifications about the graphics. The Graphics window shows the three-dimensional geometry model, depending on the tree object selection, shows information about the object details, highlighted areas, and annotations. The Output window displays the messages from the system or solvers. The Spreadsheet window shows the worksheet data for specific tree objects. Those user interface components are described in the following sections: Project explorer \u00b6 The object Tree list represents the logical steps of the conducted simulation study. All branches relate to the parenting object. For instance, a key object called Study contains Study Settings and boundary condition objects. The user can right click on an object to activate a context menu that relates to the clicked object. The objects can be copied, pasted, duplicated, and renamed. An example of the Project Explorer window is shown in Figure below. Note The tree outline contains all elements that applied in the simulation study. The root object displays the number of projects in the solution. The Material project node includes all material specification. The FEM project contains the analysis settings, multiple FEM projects are allowed in the solution. Knowing the tree objects \u00b6 The tree objects in the Project Explorer window have the following conventions: Object Icon appears to the left of the object in the tree list. The icon is intended for users to identify the type of object. For example, icons for computational results always consist of three colors (red, green, and blue), which can help distinguish other objects. A right-head arrow symbol to the left of the object indicates that this object contains child sub-objects. Clicking the arrow to expand the object and display the children. A down-head arrow symbol to the left of the object indicates that the object expends all child objects. Clicking the arrow to collapse the sub-objects. To delete an object from the tree list, you can right click on the target object and select Delete . Object status symbols \u00b6 The status icons are smaller than the tree object icon and located to the right bottom corner of the object icon. These symbols are intend to provide a quick visual reference to the status of the object. The details of the status symbols are described in Table below.

User can unsuppress the object Needs to be Updated An answers object or its child objects are not evaluated. Waiting for user to update Suppressing/Unsuppressing objects \u00b6 Most of the objects in the Project Explorer window can be suppressed or unsuppressed by users. A suppressed object means that it is excluded from the further analysis. For example, suppressing a boundary condition excludes the boundary condition from the study and the further solutions. You also can unsuppress the object with the restored object attributes. There are two ways to suppress/unsuppress an object: Right-click the object, and then select Suppress from the context menu. Or In the property view of the object, set the Suppressed option to True. Conversely, you can unsuppress objects by setting the Suppressed option to False.

Creating analysis environment \u00b6 All analyses in WELSIM are represented by one independent analysis environment. After creating a new project environment, you can choose the analysis type and define the parameters to conduct the simulation study. Unit system behavior \u00b6 The WELSIM provides eight types of unit systems for you to chose. You can select the preferred unit system from File > Preferences > General > Units . Once the unit system is chosen, quantity units of FEM objects are fixed. However, user still can select different unit for the quantity defined in material module. The material quantity will be converted to the system units at solve. Defining materials \u00b6 In simulation analysis, a geometry's attribute is influenced by the material properties that are assigned to the body. When you create a new FEM project, a material project and a structural steel material object are created automatically. This material project can include multiple material objects, which contains the material properties for the successive analysis. The system-generated structural steel can be used directly. You can add new materials by either one of the methods below: Click the Add Material button from Toolbar . Click the Add Material item from the Material Menu . Right click on the Material Project tree object, and choose Add Material item from the pop-up context menu. Editing material properties \u00b6 To manage material properties, you can double click on the material object in the tree, or right click on the material object and select Edit item from the pop-up context menu as shown in Figure below. Defining material properties \u00b6 In the material definition panel, two tabs display on the left sub-window as shown in Figure below. The Library tab gives you a quick method to add a bundle of properties for the specific type of material. The Build allows you to add each preferred property one by one. Defining analysis type \u00b6 There are several analysis types are supported in WELSIM. You can define the analysis type while performing an analysis. For example, if the temperature is to be calculated, you would choose a thermal analysis. In the FEM project object, you can set the Physics Type and Analysis Type from the Properties View window as shown in Figure below. The currently available physics and analysis types are: Structural: Static, Transient, Modal Thermal: Steady-State, Transient Electromagnetics: Electostatic, Magnetostatic Generating geometries \u00b6 There are two ways of generating geometries in the WELSIM application. You can either create primitive shapes using built-in tools or import an existing STEP/IGES file. Since the built-in tool only can create primitive shapes such as box and cylinder, it is recommended to create your complex geometry in an external application and import the CAD file into WELSIM. Create primitive shapes \u00b6 The following lists the primitive shapes that WELSIM build-in tool can create: 3D box 3D cylinder 3D plate 3D line Import geometry files \u00b6 For the complex geometry or practical designs, you can create your geometry in an external CAD application, and import to WELSIM application via STEP or IGES file. The properties view of the imported geometry allows you to define the geometry attributes, as shown in Figure below. Defining part behaviors \u00b6 The primitive and imported parts have slightly different behaviors, but the primary attributes are the same. This section describes the behaviors of the imported part. Geometry scale \u00b6 The Scale determines the size change of the imported geometry, and the current geometry size is the original size multiplied by the scale value. The default value is 1. Increasing the scale value enlarges the geometry, reducing this value causes the geometry smaller. The scale ruler on the bottom of the Graphics Window provides a reference for users to recognize the current size of the geometry. Spatial parameters \u00b6 For the imported geometry, the Spatial Parameters allows the user to adjust the origin of geometries. The default value is the origin of global coordinates (0, 0, 0). Material assignment \u00b6 Once you have defined the material objects and created the geometry, you can assign the specific material to the selected geometry object. Click Material property, and the cell displays all candidate materials in the drop-down list as shown in Figure below. Each entry includes the material object name and ID. Structure type \u00b6 The Structure Type provides a topological reference for you to differentiate the solid, shell, and beam geometries. The default structural type is Solid. Source file name \u00b6 The read-only Source property shows the information of the imported geometry file name. It provides a reference for you to identify the specific imported CAD file. Applying mesh \u00b6 Meshing is the process that your geometry is spatially discretized into finite elements and nodes. The quality of the mesh directly influences the final solutions. You can automatically mesh the geometry domains, and generate 3D tetrahedral elements (Tet10 and Tet4), or 3D triangle elements (Tri6 and Tri3). If your model does not mesh, the system applies the default settings and automatically meshes the domains at solve time. However, it is recommended to mesh the domain before solving since the system provides a reference for you to examine the mesh. Mesh Settings controls are available to assist you in adjusting the mesh density and quality. In the multi-body analysis, you can apply local Mesh Method object and scope the target bodies to achieve a finer or coarser mesh comparing to other bodies. Defining connections \u00b6 In some analyses, you may need to set up the connections such as contact. The available connection features are: Contact Pair : defines two parts are bonded or may contact during the motion. It is supported for both structural and thermal analyses. Defining study settings \u00b6 The Study and Study Settings objects are inserted automatically when you started a new FEM project in the step of Creating Analysis Environment . These two objects define the necessary conditions for the solving, such as steps, substeps, end time, convergence tolerance, etc. You can create multiple steps in the properties of the Study object. As shown in Figure below, the property Number of Steps determines the total steps in the analysis. The Current Step property of determines the current step that other properties are defining on. The spreadsheet for the Study Settings object displays the related properties for all steps. Defining initial conditions \u00b6 Based on the chosen analysis type, you can define the initial conditions to the analysis. The following initial conditions are supported: Initial Temperature : For a transient thermal analysis, you can specify an initial temperature object. The properties view of initial temperature is shown in Figure below. Applying boundary conditions \u00b6 You can impose various boundary conditions based on the types of analysis. For instance, the structural analysis allows you to impose pressure, force, displacement, and other boundary conditions. The thermal analysis enable you to impose thermal flux and temperature boundary conditions. The body conditions are imposed on the volumes instead of surfaces or edges. For example, the standard earth gravity, acceleration, and rotational velocity act on the bodies. The boundary and body conditions act according to the steps. For the multi-step analysis, the magnitude of those conditions can vary. The Tabular Data and Chart windows show related data and curves to represent the input values along time/steps. For the transient analysis, the Initial Status property provides options for the user to define the boundary value at the beginning of the simulation. As shown in Figure below, you can choose the initial value to be None or Equal to Step 1 . Solving \u00b6 The WELSIM application contains the integrated solvers. These solvers are essentially executable applications and can be instantiated by the front-end using inter-processing scheme. During the solving process, the front-end program generates the input scripts, mesh data file and feeds these files to the solvers. After calculation, the front-end interface can consume the generated result files and displays the resulting contour on the GUI. Depended on the analysis type, the following solvers are available in WELSIM: WelSimFemSolver1: solves the structural and thermal problems. WelSimFemSolver2: solves the electromagnetic problems. Solution progress \u00b6 The overall solution progress can be indicated by the Output window, where you can view the output information from the solvers. If an calculation is completed successfully, you can see the similar message below in the Output window: WelSimFemSolver2 Completed !! Evaluating results \u00b6 The WELSIM application provides fully integrated result review module, and you can evaluate simulation results with no need of other software tools. Depends on the analysis type, various results are available for you to examine solutions. The Using Results section lists all available results that may be used in the post-processing. The following lists the methods to add result objects: Right click a Answers or Result object in the tree, and choose the target result item from the context menu. Click the result button from the Menu or Toolbar. The following steps are to evaluate results: Select the target result object in the tree. If the solution is calculated, you can review the result by clicking the Evaluate button from the toolbar, menu, or the right-clicking context menu. The following result types are available: Contour results: Displays a contour plot of result over geometry surface. Probe results: Displays an annotation of the target area, and shows results in the Properties view. See the Using Results section for more details on results. Saving analysis project \u00b6 You can save the solution with all settings into an external file, and open this file later or on a different computer that has WELSIM installed. The persisted data include two parts: WELSIM database file (*.wsdb). Associated data folder, the folder name is consistent with the database file. Note The saved database file (*.wsdb) contains the information of objects and their properties. The geometry data is saved as external STEP files. The mesh and result object settings are saved. However, the mesh and result data are not included yet. You need to perform meshing and solving to obtain those data in a resumed project.","title":"Steps for using the application"},{"location":"welsim/users/steps/#steps-for-using-the-application","text":"This section discusses the workflow in performing simulation analysis in the WELSIM application.","title":"Steps for using the application"},{"location":"welsim/users/steps/#creating-analysis-environment","text":"All analyses in WELSIM are represented by one independent analysis environment.
